## Overview

This master table of contents outlines the complete structure of the Aethelgard Protocol White Paper. The document is organized into four major parts plus appendices:

1. **Foundations and Rationale** - Why we must develop planetary mobility capability
2. **Technical Architecture** - Engineering systems and specifications
3. **Governance and Social Systems** - Managing capability development across deep time
4. **Implementation Roadmap** - Phase Zero (2026-2150+) testing and beyond

Each section includes page estimates to guide document generation.

> **Timeline Note:** The Protocol operates on a realistic solar timeline (~1 billion years until ocean evaporation). Phase Zero (2026-2150+) focuses on testing and capability development, ensuring proven systems exist when solar brightening necessitates evacuation ~500 million years hence.
