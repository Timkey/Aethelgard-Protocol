It has been in this stable phase for approximately 4.6 billion years, fusing hydrogen into helium in its core through thermonuclear fusion.\n\n**Key specifications:**\n- **Mass:** 1.989 \u00d7 10\u00b3\u2070 kg (333,000 Earth masses)\n- **Radius:** 696,000 km (109 Earth diameters)\n- **Surface Temperature:** ~5,778 K\n- **Core Temperature:** ~15 million K\n- **Energy Output:** 3.828 \u00d7 10\u00b2\u2076 watts\n- **Composition:** 73% hydrogen, 25% helium, 2% heavier elements\n\nThis stability is precious.

The crew lives, reproduces, and dies aboard the ship over multiple generations, eventually reaching a new star system where descendants establish a colony.\n\n**Estimated specifications:**\n- Population capacity: 10,000\u201350,000 people\n- Journey duration: 1,000\u201310,000 years (depending on propulsion)\n- Life support: Closed-loop ecosystems, artificial gravity via rotation\n- Propulsion: Fusion engines, ion drives, or nuclear pulse propulsion\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Far less energy than moving Earth (ship mass ~10\u00b9\u2070 kg vs Earth's 10\u00b2\u2074 kg)\n- Faster construction timeline (decades vs centuries)\n- Can launch multiple ships for redundancy\n- Easier course corrections and navigation\n\n### The Genetic Wall",

But the Protocol's legacy transcends planetary migration:\n\n### Legacy 1: Proof of Concept\n\n**We proved that planetary civilizations can survive stellar death.** Before Aethelgard, every species in the galaxy faced the same existential dilemma: evolve on a planet \u2192 planet's star dies \u2192 species extinct. The Protocol broke this cycle.\n\n**Implication:** If we did it, others can too. The Fermi Paradox (\"Where are all the aliens?\") may have a new answer: They're nomadic, moving between stars every few million years, invisible to our SETI telescopes searching for stationary civilizations.\n\n### Legacy 2: The Living Manifesto\n\nThe Protocol created humanity's first **self-modifying constitution**. The Living Manifesto (The Rug) evolves via Oracle synthesis\u2014amendments added when contradictions arise, never erased (preserving dissenting views as context).\n\n**Over deep time:** The Rug contains 10,000 amendments, spanning governance, ethics, theology, aesthetics. It is humanity's collective mind made explicit\u2014a civilization's operating system, debugged across generations.\n\n**Future use:** When Proxima Centauri eventually dies (4 trillion years from now), Generation 160,000,000 will reference the Rug's migration protocols. The knowledge persists.\n\n*Source: raw.txt:495-570, 1409-1467*",
