## Problematic Year References

### 🔴 HIGH Priority (9 issues)

#### Year 2050 in [20_Chapter_19]

**Line 494:** **2050-2070: Early Curriculum**

**Reason:** Near-term year in deep-time context or evacuation event

**Section:** 19.7.1 Educational Integration

**Related paragraphs:** 0

**Context:**
```

## 19.7 Societal Transformation: The First Protocol Generation

**2050-2150 Key Social Metric:** The first generation born **after** Protocol inception reaches adulthood.

Children born in 2050 turn 18 in 2068. By 2150, these "Protocol natives" (born 2050-2132) dominate society—they never knew a world where planetary migration wasn't humanity's primary goal.

### 19.7.1 Educational Integration

**2050-2070: Early Curriculum**
- K-12 schools introduce "Protocol Studies" (elective course)
- Universities add "Interstellar Engineering" majors (120 programs globally)
- Textbooks updated: astronomy includes "target exoplanet selection criteria"

**2070-2100: Mandatory Integration**
- Protocol Studies becomes required K-12 subject (alongside math, language)
- Standardized tests include questions on Dyson Swarm physics, Hive life support
- Civics courses teach Ultimate Council structure, Oracle governance

**2100-2150: Cultural Saturation**

### 19.7.2 The Psychological Toll

Not everyone thrives in a civilization restructured around deep-time thinking and multi-generational projects:

**Existential Despair (Emerges ~2080):**
- Individuals feel insignificance ("My life is a rounding error in the Protocol timeline")
- Depression rates climb 15% (2080-2110)
- Suicide clusters among engineers who realize their work won't be "finished" in their lifetimes

**Oracle Mental Health Initiative (2085-2150):**
- Mandatory therapy for Protocol workers (destigmatize mental health care)
- "Generational Framing" campaign: "You are not building the whole bridge—you are placing one stone. That stone matters."
- VR simulations of arrival at target system (let workers "experience" the future they're building toward)

By 2150, despair rates drop to baseline—society adapts to millennial timescales.

### 🟡 MEDIUM Priority (17 issues)

#### Year None in [12_Chapter_11_Hive_Cities]

**Line 276:** - Each takes 50 years to complete

**Context:** ### Phase 2: Excavation and Vitrification (Years 150-350)

**Method:**
- Deep-bore drilling creates initial shafts
- **Plasma excavation:** Superheated jets vaporize rock
- Dyson Swarm lasers focused ...

#### Year None in [21_Chapter_20]

**Line 16:** Phase Two begins approximately 10,000 years after Protocol initiation, when all major systems from Phase One have matured into routine, self-sustaining infrastructure. This is humanity's longest era—spanning tens of millions of years—during which Planetary Exodus capability becomes as unremarkable as roads or power grids were to earlier civilizations.

**Context:** **Budget Estimate:** Post-scarcity (resource allocation through Oracle coordination)

The infrastructure persists through civilizational memory, not individual understanding.

**Context:** **Cultural Evolution:**
- Early Phase Two: "We're preparing for evacuation" (purposeful)
- Mid Phase Two: "We're maintaining civilization's infrastructure" (dutiful)
